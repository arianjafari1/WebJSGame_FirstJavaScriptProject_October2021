# WebJSGame_FirstJavaScriptProject_October2021
A little JavaScript game that I made in a few days, my first time in JavaScript, I made this game to get used to JavaScript.

Fun little game that I made in October 2021, the first time I touched JavaScript, and the first time I made a web game, I liked messing around in this to get a feel for what Javascript feels like.
The game was finished in a few days, the code is very clean and readable, it's a good showcase that I can work in JavaScript and learn programming and scripting languages quickly.

When you go into the folder you will see multiple files, the "HtmlStart", is the one you should open as that is the one that will take you to my game's title screen.
The game is complete, and it has been fully tested for Chromium and Firefox based web browsers that are up to date (as of October 2021), it's probably better if no extensions are used.

To play it, just the download the code as an archive and open "HtmlStart" in your browser of choice, if the browser features that were available in October 2021 are not deprecated in your current web browser, it should run just fine.
To see the code, it would be easier to open this in Visual Studio 2019 or newer, or a code editor of your choice.
